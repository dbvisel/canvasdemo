## TODO:

* put in real fonts
* deal with different kinds of embedded docs
  * audio
  * books
  * text?
* smarter placement on canvas
  * make canvas as big as it needs to be? does this problem go away if we use percentages?
* maybe different visualizations?
  * CSS grid
  * graph network
  * present mode
